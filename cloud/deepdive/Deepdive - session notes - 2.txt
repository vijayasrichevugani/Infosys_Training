Day 2 :
Compute services 


Google Compute engine (GCE) - IaaS
 - Instance types
 - Reserve external IP address - Static IP
 - diff images, snapshots 
 - Instance template
 - Instance groups
 
 - Load balancing 
 - Autoscaling 

Google App Engine (GAE)  - PaaS- focus on code 
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)  -IaaS/PaaS
Cloud functions - serverless - FaaS


GCE Vs GAE 	Vs GKE 
GCE - you do it yourself Pizza
customized, complete control 
GAE - order from Vendor online - at your doorstep 
focus only on outcome 
GKE - order from store - yor are physically present 
cloud function - small orders - desserts/drinks.. 


GCE
On demand - 44 out of 50- release the 6 of it back to Data center 
Preemptible  - you can stop at any point  - batch loads 
lab processing 

unused VMS - bidding - 56 machines - higher risk 
 

pricing of VM - 8 hrs * 0.05 -> price of VM 
pricing of preemptible - 8 hrs * 0.05 -> price of VM + 50-60% discount 
notification time - 30 sec 

start up script /user data[script)  - during system boot - it gets executed 
shut down script  
DB operations 
commmit; 
- 

Mobile hand set - 
OS + RAM + system apps  + user installed apps [ Facebook] 

VM - linux/Windows OS + built in apps + space + configuration 

LAMP stack - Linux(os) + Apache(webserver)  + Mysql(database)  + PHP (language) - Open source 


user request <-> webserver <-> process <-> dynamic data <-> DB <-> pull out data 

Instance  + 10GB disk space 
stop your instance - appln are not accessible + billing gets stopped 

Communication 
- Protocols 
- SSH - secure shell - only for Linux machines 
- RDP - remote desktop protocol - - windows
 - HTTP - hyper text transfer protocol - internet 
 - HTTPS - secured way 

 10.128.0.29 (nic0)	
34.70.194.190  - external IP 


URL 
www.abc.com  -> IP address 
start and stop the instance - External IP is released 

STatic IP -
When allocated - it is in yoru account you are billed for it
When associated  - its in your account + used by someone- not billed /taken care by VM cost 


************
Creating VM - with a disk  [ Diks - delete on instance deletion ] - unchcked 
static IP - mapped to instance 
apache as startup script - start/stop - via cli - ssh 
front end - external IP address 

***************
difference between images and snapshot 
images 								snapshots 
instance /source disk 					disks 


INSTANCE TEMPLATE: 

Instance groups 
- Managed instance groups - MIG  - same configuration
- Unmanaged instance groups - UMIG

ASIA - Mumbai - a, b, c - Single region 

Multi region - Asia mumbai  + US central + europe 


Scaling 
vertical scaling - RAM upgrade - scale up  , scale down 
horizontal scaling - more resources  - scale in , scale out 

malicious attacks 

instance template - fuel filled inside fire extinguisher 
instacne groups - fire extinguisher
