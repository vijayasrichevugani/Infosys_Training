
GCP offers a wide variety of storage options suiting various use cases. Let us explore each of them.

OBJECT OR BLOB STORAGE - Cloud Storage 
BLOCK STORAGE - Persistent disk 
ARCHIVAL STORAGE -  Cloud Storage 
FILE STORAGE - Cloud Filestore 
MOBILE APPLICATION - Cloud Storage for Firebase 
DATA TRANSFER - Data transfer services 
COLLABORATION - Drive enterprise

GCP has 2 block storage types integrated into GCE, an IaaS product
	Persistent Disks – Network attached volumes that can be attached to VM instances
		- Each disk can be either HDD or SSD
		- Virtual Block storage volumes
		- The data stored in PD are persisted even if the instance is terminated
		- Each instance has a single root PD that contains the operating system
		- Depending on VM’s machine type, 128 volumes/64TB of Persistent disks can be attached
		- You can attach multiple PD to a single instance. 
		- PDs are suitable for usage as primary storage for file systems, databases or for any applications
		- A non-root PD can be attached to more than one instance in read-only mode, allowing you to share static data between multiple instance
		- Available within zone and are not replicated across zones
		- Two types: 
			Zonal(standard and SSD) - data stored within a single zone within a region, replicated across devices
			Regional(standard and SSD)-Regional block storage replicated in two zones in the same region
	Local SSD – directly attached to physical machine on which VM instance is running 
		- Higher throughput and lower latency as compared to PD
		- Less persistent but more flexible. 
		- On restart of VM instance, data persists. But on stopping an instance, data will be lost. 




Quiz:

1. Which is the fastest instance storage option that will still be available when an instance is stopped?

RAM disk
Standard Persistent Disk
Local SSD
SSD Persistent Disk.

2. A team of developers have launched many instances in specific zone to meet the compute requirements. To increase the storage capacity of a particular instance they have attached a PD to it with required capacity. They wish to share the static data of PD across multiple instance. Chose the appropriate option:

Static data cannot be shared across multiple instances
Persistent disk is specific to instance and cannot be shared across instances
Persistent disk can be shared across multiple instance in read-only mode only
Persistent disk can be shared across multiple instance in both read and write mode
