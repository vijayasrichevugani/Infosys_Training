Cloud Storage
==============

Key concepts:-
-------------

-> The storage class you set for an object affects the object's availability 
and pricing model.

->You can change the storage class of an existing object.

-> When you create a bucket, you can specify a default storage class for the 
bucket. When you add objects to the bucket, they inherit this storage class 
unless explicitly set otherwise.

-> If you don't specify a default storage class when you create a bucket, 
that bucket's default storage class is set to Standard Storage.

-> Changing the default storage class of a bucket does not affect any of the 
objects that already exist in the bucket.


Class descriptions:-
--------------------

The following aspects apply to all storage classes:

-> Unlimited storage with no minimum object size.
-> Worldwide accessibility and worldwide storage locations.
-> Low latency (time to first byte typically tens of milliseconds).
-> High durability (99.999999999% annual durability).
-> Geo-redundancy (availability) if the data is stored in a multi-region or dual-region.

1) Standard Storage:-
   ------------------

-> Standard Storage is best for data that is frequently accessed ("hot" data).

-> When used in a region, Standard Storage is appropriate for storing data 
in the same location as Google Kubernetes Engine clusters or 
Compute Engine instances that use the data. It reduce network charges.

-> When used in a dual-region, you still get optimized performance 
when accessing Google Cloud Platform products that are located in one of the 
associated regions, but you also get the improved availability that 
comes from storing data in geographically separate locations.

-> When used in a multi-region, Standard Storage is appropriate for storing data 
that is accessed around the world, such as serving website content, streaming 
videos, executing interactive workloads, or serving data supporting mobile and 
gaming applications.

Availability:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The availability of Standard Storage data is:

Location Type	Typical monthly availability
multi-region		>99.99%
dual-region		>99.99%
region			99.99%

If Google fails to meet that uptime, customers are eligible to receive a credit 
as described in the Cloud Storage SLA policy.


Nearline Storage:-
=================

-> Nearline Storage is a low-cost, highly durable storage service for storing 
infrequently accessed data. 

-> Nearline Storage is a better choice than Standard Storage in scenarios where 
slightly lower availability and a 30-day minimum storage duration and are 
acceptable.

-> Nearline Storage is ideal for data you plan to read or modify on average once 
per month or less. For example, if you want to continuously add files to Cloud 
Storage and plan to access those files once a month for analysis, Nearline Storage 
is a great choice.

-> Nearline Storage is also appropriate for data backup, long-tail multimedia 
content, and data archiving. 

Note, however, that for data accessed less frequently than once a year, Coldline 
Storage is the most cost-effective choice, as it offers the lowest storage costs.

Availability:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The availability of Nearline Storage data is:

Location Type		Typical monthly availability
multi-region		99.95%
dual-region		99.95%
region			99.9%


Coldline Storage:-
=================

-> Coldline Storage is a very-low-cost, highly durable storage service for data 
archiving, online backup and disaster recovery. 

-> Unlike other "cold" storage services, your data is available within milliseconds,
 not hours or days.

-> Coldline Storage is the best choice for data that you plan to access at most 
once a year, due to its slightly lower availability and 90-day minimum storage 
duration. 

-> For example:

	->Cold data storage - Infrequently accessed data, such as data stored for 
legal or regulatory reasons, can be stored at low cost as Coldline Storage and be 
available when you need it.

	->Disaster recovery - In the event of a disaster recovery event, recovery 
time is key. Cloud Storage provides low latency access to data stored as Coldline 
Storage.

Availability:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The availability of Coldline Storage data is:

Location Type		Typical monthly availability
multi-region		99.95%
dual-region		99.95%
region			99.9%


Note: To change your current objects’ storage classes, use gsutil or the
Cloud Storage API, it can not happen via the console.


Creating storage buckets steps:-
===============================

To create a new storage bucket:

-> Open the Cloud Storage browser in the Google Cloud Platform Console.
-> Click Create bucket to open the bucket creation form.

-> Enter your bucket information and click Continue to complete each step:
	-> Specify a Name, subject to the bucket name requirements.
	-> Select a Default storage class for the bucket. The default storage 
	class will be assigned by default to all objects uploaded to the bucket. 
	-> Next, select a Location where the bucket data will be permanently 
	stored.
	-> Select an Access control model to determine how you control access to 
	the bucket's objects.
	-> Optionally, you can add bucket labels, set a retention policy and choose 
	an encryption method.


Note: To change your current objects’ storage classes, use gsutil or the
Cloud Storage API, it can not happen via the console.
