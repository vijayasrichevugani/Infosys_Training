
Google’s Infrastructure as a Service [IAAS]
It offers flexible, self-managed virtual machines hosted on Google’s infrastructure 
It allows you to easily enable from single instance to global compute clusters on Google’s infrastructure with no upfront investments
Compute Engine supports autoscaling and load balancing for groups of instances

Key Components:
Compute Engine 		
	-run Large scale workloads on Virtual machines hosted on Google’s infrastructure 
App Engine 
	-A Platform for building scalable web apps and mobile backends
Container Engine 
	-Run Docker containers on Google’s infrastructure, powered by Kubernetes
Cloud Functions 
	-A server less Platform for building event-based micro services

Features offered by Compute Engine
---------------------------------

Images
-------
	- Images provides the information required to launch the instance
	- It contain a boot loader, an operating system, and a root file system
	- It is of two types :
		- Public Images
		- Private Images
	Public Images :
		Provided and maintained by Google, Open Source community and third party vendors
		All projects in GCP can access to these images and can use them to create instances
		Images are compatible to both Windows and Linux OS
		Includes  CentOS6 and Debian7 also preview support for RHEL and SUSE
	Private Images :
		You can customize your instances by creating private images of boot disk 
		and use them for creating new instances

GCP – Snapshots
----------------
	-
By using GCP regular snapshots of persistent disk you can 
    have periodic backups
You create snapshots from persistent disks (PD) even while they are in attached to running instances

Instances and Types
-------------------
A machine type is a set of virtualized hardware resources available to a virtual machine (VM) instance, including the system memory size, virtual CPU (vCPU) count, and persistent disk limits

In Compute Engine, machine types are grouped and curated for different workloads. You can choose from general-purpose machine types, memory-optimized machine types, and compute-optimized machine types.

You can select from a number of predefined machine types in each machine type family. 

If the predefined machine types do not meet your needs, you can create your own custom machine types.

Custom machine types are ideal for the following scenarios:
	- Workloads that are not a good fit for the predefined machine types that are available to you.
    	- Workloads that require more processing power or more memory, but don't need all of the upgrades that are provided by the next larger predefined machine type.


Storage Volumes - Persistant disk
---------------------------------

Static IP addresses
-------------------
-Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources can have internal IP addresses and external IP addresses. 
-Instances use these addresses to communicate with other Cloud Platform resources and external systems.
-Each VM instance can have one primary internal IP address and and one external IP address.
- To communicate between instances on the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, you can use an instance's internal IP addresses. 
-To communicate with the Internet, you must use the instance's external IP address 

Compute Engine supports two types of external IP addresses:

    - Static external IP addresses
	    Static external IP addresses are assigned to a project long term until they are explicitly released, and remain attached to a resource until they are explicitly detached.
    	    For VM instances, static external IP addresses remain attached to stopped instances until they are removed.

    - Ephemeral external IP addresses

    Ephemeral external IP addresses are available to VM instances
    Ephemeral external IP addresses remain attached to a VM instance only until the VM is stopped and restarted or the instance is terminated. 
    If an instance is stopped, any ephemeral external IP addresses assigned to the instance are released back into the general Compute Engine pool and become available for use by other projects. 
    When a stopped instance is started again, a new ephemeral external IP address is assigned to the instance.

Start up scripts:
-----------------
#! /bin/bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y apache2
cat <<EOF > /var/www/html/index.html
<html><body><h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>This page was created from a simple startup script!</p>
</body></html>
EOF





Instance Groups
----------------

Open this link: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/

An instance group is a collection of VM instances that you can manage as a single entity.

Compute Engine offers two kinds of VM instance groups:
	Managed instance groups (MIGs) 
		allow you to operate applications on multiple identical VMs. 
		You can make your workloads scalable and highly available by taking advantage of automated MIG services, including: autoscaling, autohealing, regional (multi-zone) deployment, and auto-updating.

Uses an Instance group template: 
	Start up script: 
#! /bin/bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y apache2
cat <<EOF > /var/www/html/index.html
<html><body><h1>Instance Group Demo</h1>
<p>This page is generated by instances under an Instance Group!</p>
</body></html>
EOF


    	Unmanaged instance groups 
		- allow you to load balance across a fleet of VMs that you manage yourself.

Use an Intance Group template

VM Instance Pricing
-------------------
https://cloud.google.com/compute/vm-instance-pricing 

All vCPUs, GPUs, and GB of memory are charged a minimum of 1 minute. For example, if you run your virtual machine for 30 seconds, you will be billed for 1 minute of usage.

After 1 minute, instances are charged in 1 second increments.


Google Cloud Functions
-----------------------
Google Cloud Functions is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services.

With Cloud Functions you write simple, single-purpose functions that are attached to events emitted from your cloud infrastructure and services. 

Your function is triggered when an event being watched is fired. Your code executes in a fully managed environment.
There is no need to provision any infrastructure or worry about managing any servers.

Cloud Functions can be written using JavaScript, Python 3, or Go runtimes on Google Cloud Platform.

You can take your function and run it in any standard Node.js (Node.js 6, 8 or 10), Python 3 (Python 3.7) or Go (Go 1.11) environment, which makes both portability and local testing a breeze.

Cloud Functions are stateless - 

Events and triggers
------------------- 

Cloud events are things that happen in your cloud environment. 

These might be things like changes to data in a database, files added to a storage system, or a new virtual machine instance being created.

Events occur whether or not you choose to respond to them. You create a response to an event with a trigger. 

A trigger is a declaration that you are interested in a certain event or set of events. 

Binding a function to a trigger allows you to capture and act on events. one function invocation should not rely on in-memory state set by a previous invocation.

Cloud Functions Execution Environment:
https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/exec

Cloud Functions run in a fully-managed, serverless environment where Google handles infrastructure, operating systems, and runtime environments completely on your behalf. 

Each Cloud Function runs in its own isolated secure execution context, scales automatically, and has a lifecycle independent from other functions.
